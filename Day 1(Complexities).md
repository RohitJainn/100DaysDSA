### Day 1
# Time and Space complexity

# Time complexity : 
Amount of time taken by an algorithm to run as a function of the length of the input
For making better programs and compare algorithms.

Big O Notation -> Upper Bound
Theta -> Avg Case Complexity 
Omega -> Lower Bound

- Constant time = O(1)
- Linear time = O(N)
- Logarithmic time = O(Log N)
- Quadratic time = O(N^2)
- Cubic time = O(N^3)

# Order of Time Complexities in Ascending Order
- O(1)
- O(Log N)
- O(N)
- O(N Log N)
- O(N^2)
- O(N^3)
- O(2^N)
- O(N!)

# Space Complexity : 
Amount of space taken by an algorithm to run as a function of the length of the input
